# Project Baryonyx
Project Baryonyx is focused around the restoration of a 1994 Jeep Wrangler YJ - including all the pitfalls, caveats and bits and pieces I feel could be documented for others

## Diagrams
So I can keep track of where cables, hoses and other things of complexity (beyond a nut and a bolt) will go, I will create diagrams that will hopefully allow me to put it all back together in the correct order. While official references might exist I either haven't found them or consider them disappointing, so this folder is where I'll store the source and PNG exports of the ones I have designed.

### Diagrams so Far
* [Intake Manifold Vacuum Connections](<Diagrams\Intake Manifold - Vacuum Lines.png>)
* [Climate Control Overview](<Diagrams/Climate Control System.png>)

### Diagrams Needed
* Vacuum lines going from intake manifold to both "Command-Trac 4WD" and climate control cowl vent gate vacuum motor

## Hardware
This encompanies all the fixings, fasteners and everything in between including hoses, barbs and all that other wonderful stuff. This will be organised into CSV sheets that make reference to the actual Jeep Parts Catalogue

The part catalogues are readily available online for those needing a reference - I will not be including them within this project to avoid stepping on toes.

## Parts
Non exhaustive list of all the parts that can be identified outside of the realm of the Jeep Parts Catalogue. An example of this are the headlights which are actually Hella units (same for the front position lamps mounted on the fenders).

Of course this documentation is from the perspective of a European / UK vehicle so it might not be applicable outside of this market.
