Given the scale of this restoration the vehicle will be split into chunks to both work on and replace parts.

The focus being on getting the frame and tub cleaned and welded so they can be married back together and the contents that have been gutted and strewn all over the workshop put back in the thing to free up space and the lingering thought that something hasn't been organised, bagged and tagged before it was chucked into a pile will be lost.

## Pre-Staging

Prior to actually starting any of the numbered stages I've set myself a criteria to meet before they can begin and that consists of the following:

- Interior stripped out as much as possible
- Body components such as bumper(ettes), grill, fenders, flares removed.
- Most of the electrical harnesses removes from the body and frame (as much as possible and practical)
- Body/tub off the frame and set aside
- Both the tub and frame pressure washed and cleaned up to minimise dust and crap falling off whilst moving and working on them.

## Supporting Equipment

As the main thing that encompasses a lot of work is getting the parts ready for paint and anti-corrosion measures the existing corrosion must be taken care of - wire wheeling, attacking with phosphoric acid and sand paper (while effective) are tedious, time consuming and messy.

The intention is for the larger parts to use electrolysis to allow the parts to sit overnight/for days bubbling away. These can be effortlessly wire brushed and ready to receive primer. A large 200L plastic drum has been acquired for this purpose - with some sacrificial steel, some cable and a bit of electrolyte it'll do some of the larger parts with ease.
## Stage One

Stage One deals with the rear of the vehicle - up to the point on the frame where the front of the tub sits and joins to the fenders.

It also shall encompass the fuel tank, sender and rails. Rear leaf springs and suspension components. Rear drum brakes and lines. Prop shaft to rear axle.
