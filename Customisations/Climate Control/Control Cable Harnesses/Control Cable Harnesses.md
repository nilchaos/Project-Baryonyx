The clips on the factory harnesses for the control cables (the tubing with steel control cables running through it) are getting pretty far on now. I broke all of mine in the process of removing the cables from the control panel and the climate control box.

Instead of buying new cables I am going to make my own using 3D printed clips, PTFE tubing and 1.5mm braided wire with ends. All parts, measurements and procedures will be dumped in here for everyone to be able to make their own examples. This allows for customisation (different coloured PTFE tubing and lengths) and an ability to run the cables wherever you choose.

There are three cables in total, one for the blend gate and two for the vents (one at blower motor and one at cowl to service the right hand side of the vehicle - driver if RHD or passenger if LHD)
