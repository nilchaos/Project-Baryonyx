The clips on the factory control cables (the tubing with steel control cables running through it) are getting pretty old now. I broke all of mine in the process of removing the cables from the control panel and the climate control box.

Instead of buying new cables I am going to make my own using 3D printed clips, PTFE tubing and 1.5mm braided wire with ends. All parts, measurements and procedures will be dumped in here for everyone to be able to make their own examples. This allows for customisation (different coloured PTFE tubing and lengths) and an ability to run the cables wherever you choose.

There are three cables in total, one for the blend gate, one for the defroster or footwell and one for the vent directly in front of the blower motor.

Original Part Numbers
- CABLE, Air Vent (5503 6904 (Left Vent Control) or 5503 7201 (1995) or 5503 6905 (Right Vent Control))
- CABLE, Defroster Control (5503 6908)
- CABLE, Temperature Control (5600 2699)
