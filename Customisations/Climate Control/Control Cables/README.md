# Control Cables

The clips on the factory control cables (the tubing with steel control cables running through it) are getting pretty old now. I broke all of mine in the process of removing the cables from the control panel and the climate control box.

Instead of buying new cables I am going to make my own using 3D printed clips, PTFE tubing and 1.5mm braided wire with ends. All parts, measurements and procedures will be dumped in here for everyone to be able to make their own examples. This allows for customisation (different coloured PTFE tubing and lengths) and an ability to run the cables wherever you choose.

There are three cables in total, one for the blend gate, one for the defroster or footwell and one for the vent directly in front of the blower motor.

## Original Part Numbers
- Air Vent (5503 6904 (Left Vent Control) or 5503 7201 (1995) or 5503 6905 (Right Vent Control))
- Defroster Control (5503 6908)
- Temperature Control (5600 2699)

## General Assembly

### With Glue

 1. Cut PTFE tubing to length required, using the above lengths as guides. If you are wanting to use adhesive pads to keep the cable close to the housing then cut a little bit longer
 2. Prepare the ends of the PTFE tube by keying them with some sandpaper
 3. Prepare a small amount of epoxy resin or other suitable adhesive for PTFE bonding
 4. Dab a little on the tubing end and in the 3D printed clip housing
 5. Press the tubing into the clip and leave to set for the curing period of the adhesive
 6. Drill through the end of the clip if too much adhesive was used and has blocked the hole
 7. Cut a length of braided steel wire to the length of the PTFE tubing + xcm
 8. Thread wire through tubing
 9. Loop ends through wiring clamps
 10. Tighten one clamp down, the other one will be tightened once the length and function is tested and adjusted
 11. Adjust the length of the wire through the remaining clip by tightening it a little and then moving the heat/vent knobs until the required travel is achieved
 12. Trim excess wire length and tighten clamps fully
 13. Dab a little thread locker on the ends of the bolts on the clip
