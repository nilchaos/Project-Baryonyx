# Customisations

This is where I stray further from God's light, too preoccupied if I could I never stopped to ask myself if I should.

# The List

## Climate Control

### Control Cables

While there is nothing inherently wrong with the cables themselves, the clips that attach them to the the control panel and ducting box have broken in places - there's various ways to deal with this (cable/zip ties are the most common). I want to design and create a system that can use standard braided wire (used in hanging things from the ceiling), PTFE tubing and 3D printed parts.

This allows replacements to be made up from easily obtainable components.

### Ducting

### Mounting Flange
I want to remove as much self tapping hardware as possible as I can imagine that it'll eventually wear and I'll have to upsize or adapt.

Just below the cowling, where the air inlet is, I will create a flange that will hold metric nuts - this will allow me to use machine screws to attach the duct and intake cover without using self tapping screws.

## Electrical

### Anderson Sockets

Anderson connectors at the front and rear, with the rear being a bulkhead mount somewhere tidy so it doesn't interfere with the rear bench seat or potential cargo. This will allow me to power auxiliary items and provide a jump point with custom cables. Ideally away from the fuel filler lines to avoid fumes and sparks.

### Audio Upgrade

The two 6x4 speakers mounted in the dash will probably be pretty aneamic. Pods could also be made to mount speakers on the roll bars if a suitable after market solution cannot be found. A dedicated amplifier will also be installed somewhere - for both listening to audio and playing sound effects.
