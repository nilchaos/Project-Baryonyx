# Customisations

This is where I stray further from God's light, too preoccupied if I could I never stopped to ask myself if I should.

# The List
## Climate Control
### Control Cables
While there is nothing inherently wrong with the cables themselves, the clips that attach them to the the control panel and ducting box have broken in places - there's various ways to deal with this (cable/zip ties are the most common). I want to design and create a system that can use standard braided wire (used in hanging things from the ceiling), PTFE tubing and 3D printed parts.

This allows replacements to be made up from easily obtainable components.

### Ducting
### Mounting Flange
I want to remove as much self tapping hardware as possible as I can imagine that it'll eventually wear and I'll have to upsize or adapt.

Just below the cowling, where the air inlet is, I will create a flange that will hold metric nuts - this will allow me to use machine screws to attach the duct and intake cover without using self tapping screws.
