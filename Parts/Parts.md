# Parts
Non exhaustive list of all the parts that can be identified outside of the realm of the Jeep Parts Catalogue. An example of this are the headlights which are actually Hella units (same for the front position lamps mounted on the fenders).

Of course this documentation is from the perspective of a European / UK vehicle so it might not be applicable outside of this market.
